# What's for dinner
This app fetches data from a [user-generated recipe API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and randomly presents different recipes based on category. It first fetches the different category endpoints based on user input. It then fetches a second endpoint for that specific category and generates a random recipe, along with links to the original recipe.

The app uses Javascript, along with HTML and CSS.

## Installation
Clone the repository on your local machine in an appropriate folder: ``` git clone https://github.com/Andreawingardh/What-s-for-dinner.git ```

This app started as an assignment in fetching APIs at YRGO Higher Education Vocational School.
