- **Random Recipe Generation**: Get a random recipe from your selected category
- **Detailed Recipe Information**: View recipe title, image, country of origin, ingredients with measurements, and full instructions
- **Source Links**: Direct links to the original recipe sources for further information

## Technologies Used

## How It Works

1. The app connects to TheMealDB's API to fetch available recipes by category
2. When a user selects a category, the app:
   - Fetches all meals in that category
   - Randomly selects one meal from the results
   - Fetches detailed information about the selected meal
   - Displays the recipe with all relevant information
3. Users can select a different category at any time to get a new random recipe
